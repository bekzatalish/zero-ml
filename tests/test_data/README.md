1. radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
2. texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
3. perimeter
4. area
5. smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
6. compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
7. concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
8. concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
9. symmetry
10. fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
11. target (whether diagnosis is benign or malignant)
